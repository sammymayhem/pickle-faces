# The Many Faces of Pickles

## Description

Welcome pickle enthusiasts and novices! The aim of my site is to show you the many joys that can come from the humble pickle. From nutritoinal facts to fun recipes, come take a look at all the ways you can dress up or dress down a pickle! 

My motivation for making this site came from my wife. She loves everything pickle and I thought it would be fun to make a site honoring her favorite treat. This was a particularly fun project as I learned how to reuse components and better create a single page wesite.
